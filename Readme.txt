This is a Readme file to make your life easier:

This template Project is created using swift 3 Language.

CocoaPods are integrated in this project, so you should open the .xcworkspace 

Check the Podfile and feel free to include or remove any library.

Fabric & Crashlytics & SVProgressHUD, are imported but not implemented yet for more customisation.

There is a Singleton Manager class that have some useful methods for creating, setting, saving User objects etc.. And all the API requests are recommended to be done in this class for more freedom when creating the user object.

There is a Utility Class which contains a bunch of useful functions in order to reduce code and enhance reusability in our code.

There is a created folder named “ServerInterface”, this folder includes 3 classes concerning the networking stuff. These classes are written by a teammate, but may have some issues, feel free to remove this interface for the behalf of using a third-party library like Alamofire or whatever library you may find yourself okay with.

You can easily figure out that all classes are found inside named folders to keep our project pretty and easy to dig in. Please don’t make your project a mess.


Manager & Utility classes’ functions all have comments to help.
